## Connect MXChip IoT DevKit AZ3166 to the IoT Remote Monitoring solution accelerator

In this tutorial, you learn how to run a sample app on your DevKit to send sensor data to your Azure IoT Suite.

## About IoT DevKit

The [MXChip IoT DevKit](https://aka.ms/iot-devkit) (a.k.a. IoT DevKit) is an all-in-one Arduino compatible board with rich peripherals and sensors. You can develop for it using [Azure IoT Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools). And it comes with a growing [projects catalog](https://aka.ms/devkit/project-catalog) to guide you prototype Internet of Things (IoT) solutions that take advantage of Microsoft Azure services.


## What you need

Finish the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/mxchip-iot-devkit-get-started/sample/) to:

* Have your DevKit connected to Wi-Fi.
* Prepare the development environment.

## Before you start

Before you write any code for your device, deploy your Remote Monitoring solution accelerator and add a new physical device to the solution.

### Deploy your Remote Monitoring solution accelerator

The **AZ3166** device you create in this tutorial sends data to an instance of the [Remote Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-accelerators/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-explore) solution accelerator. If you haven't already provisioned the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator in your Azure account, see [Deploy the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-accelerators/iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-deploy)

When the deployment process for the Remote Monitoring solution finishes, click **Launch** to open the solution dashboard in your browser.

### Add your device to the Remote Monitoring solution

> Note: If you have already added a device in your solution, you can skip this step. However, the next step requires your device connection string. You can retrieve a device's connection string from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or using the [az iot](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/iot?view=azure-cli-latest) CLI tool.

For a device to connect to the solution accelerator, it must identify itself to IoT Hub using valid credentials. You have the opportunity to save the device connection string that contains these credentials when you add the device the solution. You include the device connection string in your client application later in this tutorial.

In the portal, go to **Devices** section and there, click in the  **+New Device** button. 

![Adding a new device](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-add-device.png)

The *new device form* should be filled in.
1. Click **Physical** in the *Device type* section.
2. Define your own Device ID (for example *MXChip* or *AZ3166*).
3. Choose **Auto generate keys** in the *Authentication key* section.
4. Click *Apply* button.

![Adding a new device form](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-add-new-device-form.png)

Wait until the portal finishes the provisioning of the new device.


Then the configuration of the new device, will be shown.
Copy the **Connection String** generated.

![Device Connection String](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-new-device-connstring.png)


This connection string will be used in the next section.

## Open the Remote Monitoring sample

### A. Start VS Code

* Start Visual Studio Code.
* Make sure [Azure IoT Device Workbench](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-iot-workbench) is installed.
* Connect IoT DevKit to your PC.

### B. Open Azure IoT Device Workbench Examples

Use `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the command palette, type **Azure IoT Device Workbench**, and then select **Open Examples...**.

![IoT Device Workbench: Examples](media/iot-workbench-examples-cmd.png)

Select **IoT DevKit**.

![IoT Device Workbench: Examples -> Select board](media/iot-workbench-examples-board.png)

Then the **IoT Device Workbench Example** window is shown up.

![IoT Device Workbench, Examples window](media/iot-workbench-examples.png)

Find **Remote Monitoring** and click **Open Sample** button. A new VS Code window with a project folder in it opens.

![IoT Device Workbench, select Remote Monitoring example](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/iot-workbench-example.png)

## Config IoT Hub Device Connection String

1. Switch the IoT DevKit into **Configuration mode**. To do so: 

   - Hold down button **A**.

   - Push and release the **Reset** button. 

2. The screen displays the DevKit ID and 'Configuration'.

3. Open the command palette and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Config Device Settings**.    

	![IoT Device Workbench:Device -> Settings](media/iot-workbench-device-settings.png) 

4. Select **Config Device Connection String**.       

5. Select **Select IoT Hub Device Connection String**. 

	![IoT Device Workbench:Device -> Connection string](media/iot-workbench-device-string2.png) 

6. The popup menu asks you to Input IoT Hub Device Connection String. Select that option and paste the connection string.

  > The connection string should be saved in your clipboard if you followed the **Add your device to the Remote Monitoring solution** section. If not, you should go to the Azure portal and look for the IoT Hub of your Remote Monitoring resource group. There, you can see the IoT Hub connected devices and copy the Device connection string.

## Build and upload the device code

Go back to the Visual Studio Code: 

1. Open the command palette and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Upload Device Code**. 

	![IoT Device Workbench: Device - > Upload](media/iot-workbench-device-upload.png)

2. VS Code then starts verifying and uploading the code to your DevKit.

	![IoT Device Workbench: Device - > Uploaded](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/iot-workbench-device-uploaded.png)

3. The DevKit reboots and starts running the code.

## Test the project

When the sample app runs, DevKit sends sensor data over Wi-Fi to your Azure IoT Suite. To see the result, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Azure IoT Suite, and click **Devices**.

2. Click on the device name (AZ3166) a tab opens on the right side of the dashboard, where you can see the MX Chip sensors chart in real time.

## Send a C2D message
Remote Monitoring v2 allows you to invoke remote method on the device.
The MX Chip example code publishes three methods that you can see in the Method section when the sensor is selected.

![IoT DevKit Methods](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-methods.png)

You can change the color of one of the MX Chip leds using the method "LedColor". For doing it, select the checkbox of the device and click on the **Jobs** button. 

![Create a Job](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-job.png)

Choose **Run method**, the method name is **LedColor**, write a name of this job like "ChangeLedColor", and Apply.

![Job settings](media/iot-devkit-remote-monitoring/iot-suite-change-color.png)

In several seconds, your physical MX Chip should change the color of the RGB led (below of the button **A**).
